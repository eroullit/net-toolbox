What is the use of these BPF files?
====================

The BPF files contained in the directory can be used by netsniff-ng
to only push "interesting" packet to the userspace in order to process them.
As libnetcore-ng does not have a BPF compiler built-in to transform expression in BPF
code, raw BPFs are stored here.

What is the copyright status of the BPF files?
====================

The files in the directory do not have any copyright on them as they are
merely generated from a command such as:
	tcpdump -dd udp

Keep in mind that the following legal statement:

	THIS SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED ``AS IS'' AND WITHOUT ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED
	WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
	MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
