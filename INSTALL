What platforms are supported?
=============================

Currently only operating systems running on Linux kernels with
CONFIG_PACKET_MMAP enabled. This feature can be found even back
to the days of 2.4 kernels. Most operating systems ship pre-compiled
kernels that have this config option enabled and even the latest
kernel versions got rid of this option and have this functionality
built-in. However, we recommend >= 2.6.26. 

What libraries are required?
============================

Well, libc and libpthread, that's it. 
Most operating systems already have these libraries shipped.

What is required to build the project?
======================================

You will need cmake to build the project.
Even if not required, doxygen is needed to build the documentation
