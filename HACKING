Some ideas of useful contributions/projects
===========================================

The best way to propose your ideas is to outline them in a short mail to 
workgroup@netsniff-ng.org or to our public mailing list address 
netsniff-ng@googlegroups.com. We are looking forward for your proposals!
Of course, keep in mind that you can mail smaller fixes immediately.

How to make code contributions
==============================

The best way to make a contribution to netsniff-ng is to send us your 
code in the form of a unified diff against the latest released version 
and, preferably, the version from Git.
Your patch should then be sent to bugs@netsniff-ng.org .

To make a unified diff, please follow these instructions:
   
1. Remove temporary files:
    make clean

2. Rename your source tree:
    cd ..
    mv netsniff-ng-xxx netsniff-ng-xxx-snazzy-feature

3. Checkout the original netsniff-ng source alongside it:
    git clone git://github.com/danborkmann/netsniff-ng.git

4. Generate the diffs:
    diff -urNb netsniff-ng-xxx netsniff-ng-xxx-snazzy-feature > /tmp/cool.patch

5. Check the patch and remove any unnecessary patches from the file.

6. If you've added several features, it's best to send them as
   several independent patches if you can.

If you have just patched one or two files, then making patches is even
easier. For each file, just do:

  cp file.c file.c.orig
   [Make changes to file.c ...]
  diff -u file.c.orig file.c > /tmp/file.c.patch

and just send us the patch: /tmp/file.c.patch.

Code Style
==========

Before submitting your patch make sure to indent your code appropriate.
See CODING.

The idea of the outline and some general parts for this HACKING file 
derives from GNet (http://www.gnetlibrary.org/). Generally, I followed 
the general structure of their HACKING file.
